Hello. You found my github.

I've been programming for ten years since I first discovered C when I was 12.
I wanted to make games, but then eventually became interested in a lot of other CS stuff.

I'm the lead engineer and researcher at Badger Labs (badgerlabs.io). There's not much there yet, but that should be changing in the next couple weeks.

My main project is a very unusual compiler I'm working on, with the goal of rethinking software development from the ground up, focused on first principles, advanced tooling and metaprogramming, and very high performance.
I'm pretty dissatisfied with the state of modern tooling, so I intend to build something that would actually impress me, had someone else built it.

I'm also very interested in rethinking the way that software economics works. There's not much money that can be made from building compilers despite the fact that they're our most important tools. That's probably a big part of why they don't live up to my expectations; everything is a hobby project. The projects that aren't hobby projects compete with and are inspired by other hobby projects.
If you find anything from me that's monetized in any way, expect a weird funding model.

I have a lot of weird ideas and not enough interested people to spread them to. You can help change that. Feel free to tweet at me @bzogrammer.
